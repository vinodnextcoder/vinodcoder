The two appeals are directed against the orders of the Deputy Registrars
of  Trade  Marks,  Chennai  and  Delhi,  dated  30102001,  and  11101995,
respectively
When  TA  36/2003,  was  listed  for  hearing,  the  counsel  on  both  sides
represented  that  the  appellant  had  filed  an  application  for  registration  of the
trade mark T TEX before the Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks, Delhi  The said
application  of the  appellant  was  rejected  by  the  Deputy  Registrar  of Trade
Marks,  Delhi,  against  which the  appellant filed  an  appeal  CM(M)  54/1996,  on
the file  of Delhi High COUlt,  which was transferred to this Appellate Board and
numbered as TAIl 25/2003  Since, the impugned mark in both the appeals is the
same and  the  pruties  are  also  the  same,  both appeals  Crul  be  heard  together  for
joint disposal  Hence, we have heard both the appeals jointly
In  TAl36/2003,  the  appeal  is  directed  against  the  order  of the  Deputy
Registrar of Trade  Marks,  Chennai,  dated  301 02001,  wherein,  the  appellants
opposition NoMAS3302, was disallowed
The first respondent herein Mis TEXIN TEX, a partnership firm  filed an
application No493423,  to  register  a  trade  mark  label  containing  the  letter  T
within two circles  enclosed within a geometrical device  and the  word  TEX as
its  essential  feature  of the  mark  in  respect  of hosiery  goods  including  jetties,
banians, brassiers, Tshirts and collars of shirts being goods  included in class 25
of the  Trade  and  Merchandise  Marks  Act,  1958  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
ACT), claiming the  user  since  941973  The  application  was  converted  into
one for  registration in Part B of the Register and  also  subject to  a disclaimer of
the  letter  T  and  the  word  TEX  both  separately  The  application  was
advertised  in  the  Trade  Marks  Journal NoIto3,  dated  1651995  at  page  714
The appellant herein Shri Rikhab Chand Jain, the sole proprietor trading as  TT
Industries,  filed  his  notice of opposition on  2361995  to  the  registration  of the
impugned mark TTEX on the following grounds
(l/ENNI
iety of goods falling in classes 17,  18,23,24 and 25
1  The appellant is  the proprietor of a number of trade marks consisting of
the  letters  TT  with  heartlike  geometrical  device  as  well  as  several  other
(),fR,n  ,ade marks containing the letters TT as the essential features ,in  relation to  a
t  The appellant also claim the copyright in the artistic work involved in the
{S ey reason of long and extensive user of the trade mark TT, the marks are
being extensively associated by the trade and the members of the public with
the  appellant  only  and  the  appellant  had  built  up  great  reputation  and
goodwill
4  The  impugned  trade  mark  T  TEX  is  confusingly  phonetically  and
, visually  similar to  that  of the  appellants  trade  mark and  the  registration  of
the impugned mark will  be  contrary to  the  provisions of Sections  II(a) and
ll(e)  of  the  said  Act  The  first  respondents  mark  is  likely  to  cause
confusion and deception among the trade and public  The registration of the
impugned mark will be contrary to Sections  12(1) and  18(1) of the said Act
The  first  respondent  filed  its  counter  refuting  the  statement  of  the
appellant  in  its  notice  of opposition  and  denied  that  the  impugned  mark  is
phonetically  and visually  similar to  that of the  appellant and  further  stated  that
the marks are so dissimilar that there will not be any confusion or deception  in
the  trade  Even otherwise, the first  respondent  is  entitled for registration under
Section  12(3) of the said Act  The appellant filed evidence by  way of affidavit
of Shri  Rikhab  Chand Jain  in  support of its  opposition  along  with  Annexures
A  to  H  The  first  respondent  also  filed  its  evidence  in  support  of  its
application  consisting  of  an  affidavit  of  Shri  S  Nachimuthu  together  with
ExhibitsA  to  F  The  Deputy  Registrar  heard  the  matter  and  under  the
impugned order, disallowed the opposition filed by the appellant and ordered the
registration of the trade mark of the first respondent by allowing the application
The  Deputy Registrar  has  categorically  found  that the  impugned  trade  mark  is
not similar to  that of the  appellants trade  mark  and  it is  totally  dissimilar  and
distinct  and  consequently  there  will  not  be  any  confusion  or  deception  in  the
trade  The Deputy Registrar has further held that the question of considering the
issue  under  Section  12(3)  of the  Act  will  not  arise  as  there  is  no  similarity
between the  two marks  Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed appeal
NoTMAl4/2002,  on  the  file  of the  High Court of Judicature at  Madras,  which
stood transferred to this Appellate  Board  by  virtue of Section  100 of the  Tra
Marks Act,  1999, and numbered as T Al36/2003

iA I,
In  TAl125/2003,  the  facts  are  almost  identical,  wherein  the  appelCii
filed  an  application  No430335,  for  registration  of the  trade  mark  TTEX  in
respect  of  hosiery,  included  in  class  25  on  28111984,  claiming  user  as
proposed one  The said application was  advertised in the Trade Marks Journal
No  1024, dated 221992, at page  1371  The first respondent filed his notice of
opposition  stating  that  he  has  also  filed  an  application  for  registration  of the
same  trade  mark  The  evidence  was  filed  by  both  parties  After  hearing  the
matter  in  full,  the  Deputy  Registrar  of  Trade  Marks,  Delhi,  rejected  the
application  of the appellant  on the  ground  that  the  first  respondent  is  the  prior
adopter  and  user  of the  trade  mark  and  the  appellant  is  not  entitled  for  the
registration  under  Section  12(3)  also  Further,  the  trade  mark  being  identical
and similar, the appellant is not entitled for the registration of the same
We  have  heard  Shri  GK  Muthukumar,  the  learned  counsel  for  the
respondent
impugned  mark  of the  first  respondent  is  visually  and  phonetically  almost
identical  to  that of the appellant  The abbreviation form  of TTEX  will  be  TT
which  is  similar  to  that  of the  appellants  The  Deputy  Registrar  of Trade
Marks,  Chennai, did  not consider the  fact  that the  registration of the  impugned
mark  would  create  confusion  and  deception  among  the  public  as  well  as  the
trade  Further,  the  impugned  mark  has  been  accepted  with  a  condition  of
disclaimer and  consequently,  when  the  first  respondent  cannot  claim any  right
over the trade mark, there is no purpose in allowing the registration
On  the  contrary,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  first  respondent  contended
that  the  impugned mark of his client is totally distinct and  distinguishable from
that of the appellants mark  There is no similarity between the two marks  The
first respondent has honestly adopted the trade mark and is  using the same since
1973  The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks, Delhi, has categorically found that
the  first  respondent  is  the  earlier  user  and  thereby  acquired  a  reputation  ancl
goodwilL  The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks,  Chennai, has found  that there
is no similarity in the trade mark  Both the findings being question of facts,  no
interference is called for
10  We have carefully considered the above contentions of both the counsel
11  We will take up the issue of similarity of both marks which is the prime
question for consideration in TAl36/2003
The  appellants  mark  is  TT  inscribed  within a  heart  shaped device  In
fact,  the appellant has registered the said trade mark in respect of various classes
of goods under trade mark Nos266085  as of 381970,277801  as  of2011972,
334422 and 334423 as of 1331978 and 432270  All the above registrations are
valid and subsisting  The appellant has also  registered the trade mark TT under
trade  mark  Nos432269,  432271, 432294,  432295  and  508166  Having all  the
trade  marks  registered  with  the  letters  IT,  now,  the  appellant  claims  that  the
impugned mark T TEX is similar and identical to that of its registered mark
To find  out the similarity,  both the  marks have to  be placed side by side
and should be compared as to whether anyone would be confused with the trade
mark  relating  to  the  proprietors  of the  same  As  each  case  has  to  be  decided
with the disputed trade mark in that particular case,  we  are not  inclined to  refer
to  any  precedence  The  counsel  also  did  not  refer  to  any  citation  except  the
judgment  of the  Supreme  Court  in  National  Sewing  Thread  Company  Ltd,
Chidambaram Vs James Chadwick and Brothers Ltd, reported in  AIR 1953  SC
357  to  rely  on  the  plea  under  Section  11  of the  Act  Both  the  marks  are
reproduced below for easy reference
Appellants Mark
First Respondents Mark
In  fact,  the  Deputy  Registrar  of Trade  Marks,  Chennai,  hafelaborately
discussed  the  various  ditinct features  of both  the  trade  marks  and  found  that
they are not similar  Even fJr  a sheer look of both the disputed  marks, it  is  very
clear  that  both  are  not  identical  The appellants  mark  is  only TT  whereas  the
first  respondents  mark  is  TTEX
If anybody  wants  the  goods  or  the  first
respondent,  they  will  ask  for  TTEX,  which  is  phonetically  as  well  as  visually
different  from  that  of  the  appellants  mark  IT  Since,  we  arc  entirely  in
agreement  with  the  finding  Jf the  Deputy  Registrar  of Tradc  Marks,  Chcllnai,
there  is  no  need  for  us  to  repeat  the  reasoning  given  by  him  When  once  the
impugned trade mark is  distinct and different,  there  is  no  bar 101  the registration
of the  impugned  marIe  HCI1le,  the  impugned  order or the  Deputy  Registrar  of
Trade Marks, Chennai, in 1//36/2003, is confirmed and  the appeal is dismissed
Coming  to  the  issue  in  appeal  TAil 25/2003,  here,  the  appellants
application  fo  registration of the  trade  murk TTEX  was  rejected  Though  the
learned counsel for  the appcllrlllt contended  that  the  application  or rIC  appellant
adopter and  user of the  mark  ITEX,  is  naturally  entitled  ror  registration  The
learned counsel for the appellant, ofcourse, pointed out certain  infirmities in the
impugned order of the Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks,  Delhi, eOl1tending  that
the findings are not based on aIlY  reasons and as such, the same is liable to  be set
aside  Now that we have heard both the appeals  together and  we,  having 10und
that  the  first  responqcnt is  entitled  lor registration of the trade  l11ark  TTEX,  the
appellant cannot be permitted [0 have the registration of the same identical  Illark
for  its trade  Further, when  the appellant had  variolls registered  marks onty with
the  letters TT, th(re  is  absolutely no  reason  for  the  appellant as  to  why  it wants
to  change  the  trade  mark  to  TTEX,  especially,  when  at  the  time or appLcatioll
of the appellant, the first respondent had established its trade with the trade  mark
TTEX and  has  acquired a  reputation  and goodwill  Helice,  we do  not  se any
merit  in  the appeal  Accordingly,  this  appcal  is  also  dismissed  Consequcntly,
both the appeals arc dismissed  There will be no order as  to costs,
