that there  are the  same  trade  channels,  same  cnsu  :e,  Gt)
argued
and  same trade connections  in  relation to  both the goods} This fa
has  neither  been  denied  nor  challenged  in  the  pleadings  of  the
appellant  Even  the  evidence  adduced  in  this  regard  remains
unrebutted  There is complete identity of the marks  He relied  upon
the  following, observations  of the  Supreme  Court  in  Corn  Products
Refining Co, Vs  Shangrila Foods AIR  1960 SC  142:
Where  there
are  a  series  of  marks,  registered  or 
unregistered,  having  a common  feature  or a common  syllable,  if the 
marks  in  the  series  are  owned  by  different  persons,  this  tends  to 
assist the applicant for a mark  containing  the common  feature  But 
before the applicant can seek to derive assistance for the success of 
his  application  for  registration  from  the  presence  of  a  number  of 
marks having one or more common features which occur in  his mark 
also,  he  has to prove that these marks had  acquired  a reputation  by 
user in the market
On  this  score  he argued  that the  appellant's  claim  miserably fails  in
relation  to  section  11 (a)  of  the  Act  He  further  argued  that  the
relevant  date  for  the  purpose  of  assessing  distinctiveness  of  the
mark  being
21121987  when  the  application  was  made,  the
appellant  has  miserably  failed  to  support  his  claim  for  acquiring
distinctiveness  He  has  been  using  the  mark  since  1941986 only
Here  the  user is  of 20  months  only  The four invoices  which  have
been adduced to prove the user till the date of filing of the application
have  only  one  out  of those  which  relates  to  electric  iron'  Thus  the
appellant  hs  miserably  failed  to  support  his  claim  for  qualifying
under section  9 of the Act  This fact  has  been  taken  note  of by the
Assistant  Registrar  in  arriving  at  his  conclusions  at  page  9  of the
impugned  order  Besides  relying  upon the Corn  Products Case,  the
learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  referred  to  SIA  Gems  and
Jewellery PvtLtd Vs  SIA Fashion 2003 (27) PTC 227 (Bom) wherein 
;j1?;;;;:]  said  High  Court  held  that the plaintiff selling  jewellery under the 
(,  ;;?  Ir:/>  name  SIA  and  Ihe  defendanls  selling  dress  malerial  and 
( CHENt>ees in  a  shop  bearing  the  name  SIA  shall  lead  to  likelihood  of
confusion
It  was  held  that  the  defendant's  goods  are  cogent  to
plaintiffs  goods  and  thus  there  is  likelihood  of causing  damage  to
plaintiffs  reputation  He  put  his  reliance  also  upon  Shamlal  Vs
Parley  Products  AIR  1967  Madras  117  where  the  said  Court  held
that  'Pearl'  was  deceptively  similar  to  the  mark  'Parle's'  and  was
likely to  cause  confusion  in  the  minds  of public
In  Kumar  Electric
Works  Vs  Anuj  Electronics  1990  PTC  26  DEL,  the  High  Court  of
Delhi  held  that  the  trade  mark  'OLYMPUS'  registered  in  respect  of
electric  flat  iron  in  the  name  of  the  plaintiffs  attracts  the  case  of
infringement  and  passingoff for  the  use  of the  same  mark  by  the
defendant in  respect of television sets
We  have  carefully  considered  the  contentions  of  both  the
counsel  and  find  that  with  a  view  to  qualify  for  registration  for  the
purpose  of section  9 of the Act the mark should  be distinctive of the
goods of the proprietor or if it is not distinctive it should be capable of
distinguishing the goods of the proprietor from the other proprietor  It
is  sufficient to conclude that the  use of hardly for 20  months prior to
the filing  of application for registration  of the mark has no capacity to
acquire distinctiveness  Further, the mark being a name or surname,
is  inherently non  distinctive and  is thus  not capable of distinguishing
the  goods  of  its  proprietor  from  that  of  the  goods  of' the  other
proprietor
It  has to  acquire  distinctiveness  over a  long  use  with  a
view  to  be  capable of  distinguishing  the  goods  Whereas  the
respondent's  mark 'MILTON' is in  abundant use since 1971  Thus
the  appellant miserably fails  in  his  claim  under section  9 of the Act
In  matter  of  scrutiny  under  section  11 (a)  of  the  Act,  the  learned
counsel  for  the  appellant  marshalled  n:tany  instances  in  supporting
his  claim  However,  we  find  that  much  of  them  are  either  not
relatable  to  the  issues  or  in  some  of  them,  looking  into  the  very
character  and  nature  of the marks  and  the  description  of goods for
which they are being  used,  it has been held that the goods belong to
different  description and thus there is  no likelihood of any confusion
The  Vazir  Sultan  case
is  a  land  mark  case  in  relation  to
rectification of  the  Register  wh''re  simply for the  non  user  of  the
mark  for certain  specific  goods  the  rectification  of  the  Re  enTY<1
was  done  However,  while  passing  orders  on
Supreme Court has very clearly spelled out that they have notY}5i> J?
this  sc ,::<  tf
cfl NNf>,
gone  into  the  merits  of the  registration  application  of the  plaintiff in
relation to the products which they have ordered  to be excluded from
purview  of category  of tobacco  for  which  the  registration  was  held
Hence  the  said  judgement  is  of  no  hold  to  the  appellant  in  the
present  case  To  the  contrary,  there  is  a strong  case  to  reach  the
conclusion that the requisite parameters required  for qualifying under
section  9  of the  Act  are  grossly  lacking  in  view  of the  user  of the
mark  being  for  a  very  limited  period  of  20  months  and  that  too
confined to a specific item relating to electrical goods, that is,  electric
iron  Similarly,  there  being  the  same  consumers,  same  trade
channels  and  same  selling  outlets  for  both  the  products  and  there
being closer similarity amongst the goods, there is every likelihood of
causing  confusion  to  attract  disqualification  under  section  11 (a)  of
the Act  Since the very distinctiveness  acquired  or potential  is
jeopardy under section  9 of the Act,  the  right of proprietorship  under
section  18  of  the  Act  cannot  be  made  available  The  honest
concurrent  use  under section  12(3)  of the A'Ct  needs the  use  surely
which  has ,to  be  honest  and  concurrently  but  over  a  long  period,
which is patently lacking in the present case
In  view  of the  above  we  feel  that the Assistant  Registrar  of
Trade Marks has rightly disallowed the registration  and  accepted the
opposition  Hence the appeal is dismissed with  no order as to /'';;E'
