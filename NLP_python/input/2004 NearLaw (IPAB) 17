Honble Shri Justice SJagadeesan, Chairman
When  the  case was  called  neither the  applicant  nor the first
respondent nor their counsel were present  Hence we  passed  over
the case and once again called  at the end of the list  There was no
representation  for any of the parties,  even  at that time  Hence the
application is dismissed for non prosecution  No costs
