The appeal  is  against the order of the  Assistant registrar of Trade Marks, New

The  appellant  herein  above  filed  an Application No421055,  dated  2541984,
for registration of a trade mark MARCONI in clause 9  in  respect of the  goods, viz,

since  December,  1969  The  said  application  of the  appellant  was  advertised  in  the
Trade Mark Journa1 dated 1 11990 at page 1230
The respondents herein above on 921990 filed a notice of opposition objecting
to  the registration of Trade  Mark of the appellant  contending that the  respondents are
carrying on an established business on manufacturing various electric  goods under the
Trade Mark  MARCONI and  the same  had  been registered  in India in class  9  under
No367767,  dated  22nd  October,  1980,  in  respect  of Scientific,  Nautical,  Avionic,

the aforesaid goods  The word MARCONI is also registered under No367768 dated
2200  October,  1980 in class 9 in respect of Scientific, nautical, Surveying and electrical
apparatus  and  instruments  (including  wireless),  telephonic,  television  and  telegraphic

and fitting  for  the  aforesaid goods  The said Trade mark MARCONI has  also  been
registered  in  class  9  under Nos86285  and  86286,  dated  20lh  September,  1943,  under
No214419, dated 21 st March,  1963 and under No324592, dated 15lh  April,  1977, all in
class  9  All  the above trade  marks  are  being periodically renewed  and  are  valid and
subsisting  The  respondents  further  stated that they  are  using  the  said  trade  mark  in
India  since  the  last  several  decades  as  registered  mark  since  1943  being  renewed
periodically  and  by the reason of the same, they developed reputation and goodwill  in
India  as  well  as  in  the  international  market  Since  the  appellant  applied  for  the
registration ofan identical mark in respect of similar and for the same description ofthe
goods, the  registration is prohibited under  Sections  12(1)  and  Il(a) of the  Trade and
Merchandise  Mark  Act,  1958  The  adoption  of the  impugned  trade  mark  by  the
Sections 9,  11(a), 11(e), 12(1), 12(3) and 18(1) ofthe Act
appellant  is  with  dishonest  intention  The  objection  of the  appellant  were  under   /,
In the counter statement, the appellants contended that they are  in the  business I

since the year 1969 and are using the trade mark MARCONI without any interruption
or hindrance  Further, the  appellant  filed  a  suit  in the year  1984 in the Honble  High
Court of Delhi and they had obtained a decree in their favour declaring that they are the
Ili
proprietors ofthe impugned trade mark  It is also stated that the respondents acquiesced
to the use of the impugned trade mark  by the appellants since they had not taken any
action  against  the  appellants,  knowing  the  use  of the  impugned  trade  mark  by  the
appellants
The  respondents  filed  evidence  by  way  of an  affidavit  of Mr  Eric  Albert
Peachey along with ExhibitsA series and B series  The appellant also rued evidence
by way ofaffidavit of Mr AA Nizami along with the copies of sales invoices Exhibits
Al to All and AnnexureB  After hearing both the counsels, the impugned order was
passed by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks  allowing the opposition filed  by the
respondents and rejecting the application of the appellant for registration on the ground
that there is no  honesty in the adoption ofthe impugned trade mark by the appellant and
the  trade  mark  is  identical  and  similar  to  the  respondents  trade  mark  which  would
naturally  cause  confusion  in  the  minds  of the  customers  Further,  the  Assistant
Registrar held  that the  goods  of both the  parties  also  similar  Aggrieved  by the  said
order ofthe Assistant Registrar, the present appeal was rued by the appellant on the file
of the  Honble  High  Court,  Delhi
In  view  of  Section  100  of the  Trade  and
Merchandise Act,  1999, the appeal was transferred to  the Appellate Board  We heard
the appeal
The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  that  the  Assistant  Registrar
erred in finding that the goods are similar and that the appellants adopted the impugned
trade  mark  with dishonest  intention  by  totally overlooking the judgment of the  Delhi
High Court,  which is  in their favour  declaring that they are the proprietors of the said
trade  mark  The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  further  contended  that  the
respondents  are  not  using  their  trade  mark  within  India  and  they  do  not  have  any
reputation or goodwill  in India and  as  such it  is  not open to  them to  claim any  right
under the registration of Trade mark  He further  submitted that  MARCONI is not an
invented word, but the name of a Scientist and nobody can claim proprietorship to that
name
Per contra, the counsel for the respondents contended that the appellants filed an
application  for  the  registration  of the  impugned  trade  mark  as  early  as  1969  and
subsequently the same was withdrawn  After quite some time, the appellant once again
filed  the  application  for  the  registration  of the  impugned  trade  mark,  perhaps  after
creating  evidence  to  claim the  use  of the  trade mark  So  far  as  the judgment  of the
Delhi High Court relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant is concerned, it is
contended that the  respondents  are  not  parties  to the proceedings  and moreover,  in  a
matter  of this  nature,  it  is  open  to  the  appellant  to  rely  upon  the  earlier  judgment
wherein the respondents are not parties and the judgment is not in rem
He  contended  that  the  Registrar,  after  careful  consideration  of the  materials
available on record, found that both the trade marks are similar and it would cause more
confusion in the trade
We  have carefully considered the above  contentions of both the counsels  The
undisputed  facts  are  that  the  appellant  applied  for  the  registration  of the  word  trade
mark MARCONI for the specification ofthe goods, viz,  Record layer,  Ampligrarns,
Radiograms and Stereo sound system  The respondent is the registered proprietor of the
same trade mark  The appellant filed an application for the registration ofthe impugned
trade mark as early as 1978 and the  same was withdrawn  The appellant filed a  suit in
the Delhi High  Court (Suit No9521I984)  against one Nirmal  Electronics  and  the  suit
was decreed exparte on 13101987
The learned counsel  for the  appellant  contended that the  goods are  not  similar
and further  contended that the  appellant  honestly  used  the trade  mark  since  1969  and
further in view of the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the Civil Suit No952/1984,
the  appellants  are  entitled  for  the  registration  and  the  opposition  filed  by  the
respondents  has  no  merits  They  also  contended  that  withdrawal  of their  earlier
application is  no  bar  for  the disposal  of the present appeal since there  is  no bar  in the
statute with regard  to the  withdrawal  application  and  filing  of a  fresh application at a
futtrre date

with the above contentions, we have to  keep in mind that there is
no  dispute  with regard  to  similarity  of both the  trade  marks,  ie,  the  registered  trade
mark of the respondents and the trade mark of the appellant claiming to  be in use  The
Assistant  Registar of Trade  Marks  found  that  the  goods  of both the  parties  also  are
identicaL  The description of the goods of the  respondents were given above  Similarly
the description of the goods ofthe appellant for which the registration of the trade mark
is sought for,  is also given above  A perusal ofthe same would establish that there is no
doubt  that  the  goods  are  of the  same  categories  The  nomenclature  may  differ,  but

part of the appellant and the effect that the withdrawal ofthe earlier application and the
judgment ofthe Delhi High Court decree
The  appellant  filed  am application under  No342926  on  21 51  November,  1978,
for  the  same  mark  in class  9  and  had  withdrawn the  same  later  After  six  years,  the
appellant once again filed application No421055  for the registration of the same  mark
claiming  the  use  since  1969  As  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant,
there  is  no  bar for vithdrawal of the earlier application and filing  of a fresh application
later  However,  the  conduct  of the  party  in  both  the  circumstances  are  relevant  to
decide  the  issue  The  appellant failed  to  give any reason for  the  withdrawal  of earlier
application filed  in the  year  1978  When that  fact  had  been  totally  suppressed  in  the
fresh application,  naturally,  the  bonafide  of the  appellant  is  doubted  It also  throws a
doubt  with  regard  to  the  evidence  produced  at  present,  especially  in  respect  of the
period  1969 to  197  It is observed that most of the invoices are for the year 1975 and
all the sales are made to only one customer, Le, MIs  National Music Emporium, Delhi
The  registration  of the  trade  mark  by  the  respondents  is  as  early  as  1943
Subsequently,  they  obtained  many  registrations of the  mark  in  class 9 for  other goods
also  When the respondents  trade mark is  a registered one,  who  are also having trade
within  India,  the  statement  of the  appellant  that  there  is  no  similar trade  mark  in the
trade is totally a false one, especially in the absence of any material to  establish that the
appellant  made  an honest  effort  to  verify  the  use  of the  same trade  mark  by  any  other
trader
In  the  absence  of such  materials,  we  have  to  hold  that  the  adoption  of an
identical registered trade mark cannot be considered to be a honest one  Here again, we
concur with the findings of the  Assistant  Registrar that the  appellants use of the same
trade  mark similar to  that of the respondent  is  not  bonafide  The appellants have  not
only dishonestly adopted the trade mark but also the trading style ofthe respondents
Coming  to  the  question  of the  judgment  of the  Delhi  High  Court  in  OS
No952J1984,  admittedly,  the  respondent  is  not  a  party  to  the  said  proceedings  The
said suit was decreed exparte in favour ofthe appellant  The judgment is  not in rem,
because the use  of the  trade  mark  by  each party has to  be  considered on the evidence
produced by them independently  A decree with regard to the proprietorship ofthe said
trade  mark  against  an  individual  cannot  be  binding  on others as universal,  especially
when  dispute  has  to  be  decided  with  regard  to  the  evidence  of the  particular  case
Hence,  the  claim of the appellant that they are the proprietors of the trade mark  on the
basis ofthe decree passed by the High Court, Delhi, cannot be sustained
For all  these  reasons,  the appeal  is dismissed
